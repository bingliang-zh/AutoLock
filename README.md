Auto lock computer using Arduino Micro.

Two infrared sensor will do detecting job about whether my Nexus 6 is on my Qi wireless charger.

If I remove my Nexus 6 from my wireless charger, this "Auto Lock Device" will input "Win + L" to my computer to lock it. The Arduino Micro must connect to the computer via USB cable.

Only a few Arduino devices can do keyboard input things. Check this out if you don't have an Arduino Micro but some other Arduino devices and want to try.  [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/MouseKeyboard](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/MouseKeyboard)
